\title{Enhanced results summary function with detailed plot descriptions and improved error handling}
\usage{
summarize_results(results, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{List of analysis results from \code{execute_code()} or your own analysis.}

\item{data}{Original dataset used for analysis (for context).}
}
\value{
Text description of results including detailed plot analysis
}
\description{
Generates a detailed textual summary of analysis results, including model outputs,
statistical tests, and plot descriptions. This function is particularly useful for
understanding what visualizations show when you can't see them directly (e.g., when
working with an LLM).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Execute some analysis code
analysis_results <- execute_code(mtcars, "
  model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = data)
  summary_model <- summary(model)
  scatter_plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = hp)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = 'MPG vs Weight, colored by Horsepower')
")

# Summarize the results
results_summary <- summarize_results(analysis_results, mtcars)
}
